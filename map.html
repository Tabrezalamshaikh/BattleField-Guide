            <div class="col-md-7" style=" color: white;">
                <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="color: #5656fa;">Vikendi
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">1. Setting: It is distinct for its extensive winter environment, featuring deep snow,
                    icy
                    terrain, and frozen lakes, which significantly impacts gameplay and player visibility.</p>

                <p class="lead">2. Size & Scale: The map is reasonably sized, featuring a scale bar that shows the main
                    island is several kilometers across.</p>

                <p class="lead">3. Key Locations: Major named areas are scattered across the map, including popular drop
                    zones like School, Cosmodrome, Castle, and coastal towns.</p>

                <p class="lead">4. Named Cities/Areas: Prominent locations include Sanshok in the north, El Pozo and
                    Ebnéd in the west,
                    Saanovska and Nove puye in the south, and Georgopole (split into Georgopol I and II) in the
                    northeast.</p>

                <p class="lead">5. Central Features: The map's center is characterized by mountainous terrain and is
                    home to the School and
                    Cashuk areas.</p>

                <p class="lead">6. Waterways: A river or strait cuts through the lower central section, connecting to
                    the coast and
                    separating the main landmass.</p>

                <p class="lead">7. Strategic Points: The large, flat area around School and the high-loot buildings near
                    Cosmodrome are
                    crucial for early-game engagements.</p>

                <p class="lead">8. Tactical Gameplay: The open, snowy fields favor long-range engagements, while the
                    dense forests and
                    urban centers offer opportunities for close-quarters combat.</p>

                <p class="lead">9. Vehicles: Vehicles are essential for traversing the vast, slippery landscape, though
                    snowmobiles are
                    often preferred for mobility.</p>

                <p class="lead">10. Unique Features: The snow cover can reveal footprints, adding a unique tracking
                    element to the gameplay.</p>

                <p class="lead">11. Loot Distribution: Loot appears to be concentrated in the larger settlements, marked
                    by clusters of
                    buildings.</p>

                <p class="lead">12. Compass & Grid: The map includes a compass rose (N, E, S, W) and a basic grid
                    structure for navigation
                    and communication.</p>

                <p class="lead">13. Distinct Look: The overall aesthetic is one of rugged, remote, and cold wilderness.
                </p>

            <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2" style="color: greenyellow;">
                <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="color: #5656fa;">Erangal
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">Size and Theme: It is a large, 8x8 km map characterized by its lush, temperate, and
                    forested environment, set on a fictional Russian island.</p>

                <p class="lead">1. Terrain Diversity: The map offers a great variety of terrain, including large open
                    fields, rolling
                    hills, dense forests, and numerous urban areas.</p>

                <p class="lead">2. Key Locations: Several highly contested and popular drop zones are visible, such as
                    Pochinki, the
                    School, Rozhok, and the Sosnovka Military Base.</p>

                <p class="lead">3. Urban Hubs: Pochinki is centrally located and infamous for early-game close-quarters
                    combat (CQC)
                    due to its dense cluster of buildings.</p>

                <p class="lead">4. High-Loot Zones: The Military Base (on the separate southern island) is a high-risk,
                    high-reward
                    area, known for spawning the best loot and armor.</p>

                <p class="lead">5. Bridges and Strategy: Access to the Military Base is restricted by two main bridges,
                    which are
                    common choke points and critical for end-game rotation strategies.</p>

                <p class="lead">6. Geographical Features: The map features a large mainland and a smaller Sosnovka
                    Island in the south,
                    separated by a sea channel.</p>

                <p class="lead">7. Centrality: Locations like Rozhok and the School are near the map's center, making
                    them
                    strategically important as the safe zone often closes around them.</p>

                <p class="lead">8. Vehicle Importance: Due to the 8x8 km size, vehicles are essential for crossing long
                    distances and
                    escaping the blue zone.</p>

                <p class="lead"> 9. Coastal Areas: Towns like Georgopol and Novorepnoye are on the coast, often
                    providing access to
                    boats for rotation.</p>

                <p class="lead">10. Gameplay Mix: Erangel supports all styles of play, from aggressive urban fighting to
                    tactical
                    sniping across open fields.</p>

                <p class="lead">11.Iconic Landmarks: Other notable points include Gartach and the scattered settlements
                    of Sosnovka (on
                    the main island).</p>

                <p class="lead">12. Overall Vibe: The map has a gritty, post-Soviet atmosphere with abandoned facilities
                    and barracks,
                    reflecting its fictional backstory.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading" style="color: #5656fa;">Miramar.
                </h2>
                <p class="lead">1. Setting and Scale: It is a large, 8x8 km map, defined by its desert theme, featuring
                    brown, sandy
                    terrain, canyons, and rocky hills.</p>

                <p class="lead">2. Open Terrain: The map is characterized by much more open ground compared to Erangel,
                    which favors
                    long-range engagements and sniping.</p>

                <p class="lead">3. Key Locations: Major, densely packed urban centers include Los Leones (the largest
                    city), El Pozo, and
                    Pecado, which are known for high-risk, high-reward drops.</p>

                <p class="lead">4. Unique Structures: The map features many multi-story buildings, warehouses, and the
                    iconic Casino and
                    Boxing Arena in Pecado.</p>

                <p class="lead">5. Strategic Challenge: The open terrain makes rotation difficult, as players are
                    often exposed and
                    vulnerable to enemy fire from high ground.</p>

                <p class="lead">6. Topography: The map is very hilly and mountainous, especially in the central and
                    western regions,
                    providing excellent vantage points for snipers.</p>

                <p class="lead">7. Vehicle Necessity: Vehicles are absolutely critical for survival and timely
                    rotations due to the map's
                    sheer size and the lack of cover in open areas.</p>

                <p class="lead">8. Naming Convention: Unlike the previous maps, Miramar uses Spanish-themed names for
                    its locations, such
                    as Los Hones and El Pozo.</p>

                <p class="lead">9. Loot Distribution: Loot is heavily concentrated within the major cities, leading to
                    chaotic early-game
                    fights.</p>

                <p class="lead">10. Coastal Areas: Coastal towns like Noverpnoye and the port areas offer alternative
                    ways to move around
                    the map.</p>

                <p class="lead">11. Tactical Considerations: The lack of lush foliage means camouflage is minimal,
                    forcing players to rely
                    on terrain elevation and structures for cover.</p>

                <p class="lead">12. Gameplay Focus: Miramar shifts the game's focus towards strategic positioning and
                    vehicle management
                    rather than constant close-quarters combat.</p>

                </h2>
                <p class="lead">1. Theme: It retains the lush, green, temperate island theme, similar to the original
                    Erangel, with dense
                    forests and grassy fields.</p>

                <p class="lead">2. Scale: The map maintains the large 8x8 km scale, evident from the scale bar at the
                    bottom left,
                    requiring significant travel time.</p>

                <p class="lead">3. Hybrid Locations: It strategically mixes classic Erangel locations like School, Rozhok,
                    Military Base,
                    and Georgopol with areas named after other maps, such as Sanshok and El Pozo.</p>

                <p class="lead">4. New Hot Drop: A notable addition is Paverdise Resort in the west, suggesting a
                    high-loot,
                    high-engagement area, potentially replacing or updating an older location.</p>

                <p class="lead">5. Central Features: The School and Rozhok remain centrally located, making them critical
                    for early-game
                    action and subsequent zone rotations.</p>

                <p class="lead">6. Southern Island: The separate southern island, featuring Sosnovska and the Military
                    Base, is still a
                    major high-tier loot zone.</p>

                <p class="lead">7. Choke Points: The bridges connecting the main island to the Military Base remain the
                    primary choke
                    points for mid-to-late-game strategy.</p>

                <p class="lead">8. Terrain: The terrain is varied, encompassing flat plains near Saanovska, mountainous
                    areas near El Pozo,
                    and coastal regions like Gartach.</p>

                <p class="lead">9. Waterways: A river system flows through the center, adding tactical elements for
                    crossing and providing
                    limited cover.</p>

                <p class="lead">10. Visual Update: The map generally has a brighter and more detailed visual style than the
                    very first
                    iteration of Erangel.</p>

                <p class="lead">11. Loot & Action: The inclusion of multiple dense urban areas ensures a wide distribution
                    of loot and
                    continuous combat opportunities.</p>

                <p class="lead">12. Gameplay Impact: The changes likely aim to refresh the gameplay experience, offering
                    veteran players new
                    drop strategies while keeping the classic Erangel feel.</p>
